# FrostBot for Discord
FrostBot for Discord is a versitile and comprehensive moderation and entertainment bot built primarely for Discord servers managed by me. I decided to create because none of the bots available in the Discord app library had all of the features I needed combined into a single bot.

## Already implemented features
Bot is in active development and more features are slowly being worked on. As such the list of features currently available is empty.

## Planned features
The following list includes all the features I want to implement in the bot. This is a living list, as such it will probably change during the development.
* Fetching information about a user (Currently WIP)
* Fetching information about a minecraft server (Currently WIP)
* User moderation
* Chat moderation
* Reaction roles
* Birthday list, birthday announcements and birthday roles
* Leveling system
* Ticketing system
* Twitch streaming notifications

## Used technologies
Bot was created using the following technologies:
* Node.js
* TypeScript
* Discord.js

### Development tools and packages
* Visual Studio Code
* Prisma
* Semantic Release
* eslint
* Prettier
